# My First Few Edits
* **Objective** - To create 4 independent webpages, each requiring specific features to be implemented.
* **Purpose** - To establish familiarity with basic HTML
* **Description**
    * You are provided with four different `html` template files in a `templates` directory at the root of this project.
    * Using the html tags that you already know, modify the html content so each individual file looks similar to their respective image.


## Part 1 - Clone the project

   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.

## Part 2 - `syntax_template.html`

* Edit the `syntax_template.html` file to have the appropriate  _typographical emphasis_.

        * adds all of the file-changes in the current directory to _staging_.
            * **Tip:** execute `pwd` to view your _present working directory_
    * `git commit -m "finished edits on 'syntax_template.html' "`
        * saves _staged changes_ to local repository along with a brief description of changes made.
    * `git push -u origin master`
